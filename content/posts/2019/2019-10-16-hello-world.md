**8/8/2020 update**: I have imported some of my older articles from Medium to this blog to consolidate everything in one spot. So this particular "hello world" appearing in the middle of other posts may look a bit weird.

**10/16/2019**:

Yes. I have started a blog ... again. This is probably my fourth attempt at creating a personal website. And as usual, I spent several hours looking at themes/templates before finally settling on this one. 

The intention of this blog is to share my thoughts and ideas on programming, engineering, spaceflight, and pretty much anything that catches my fancy. To whoever is reading this, welcome!
