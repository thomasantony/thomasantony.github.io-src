## Image Formation

An eye/camera observes a subset of all the light rays in a scene.

### Light Field

A function that maps any 3D coordinate and a ray direction to the color of that ray.

{% mathjax() %}

$$
LF: \mathbb{R}^3 \times \mathbb{S}^2 \rightarrow \mathbb{R}^3, LF(\mathbf{x}, \mathbf{d}) = \mathbf{c}
$$

{% end %}

### Pinhole Camera

Why does a paper or film just exposed directly to a scene not form an image?

- It is because each point on the paper/film gets an average/integrated sum of all the light rays hitting it.
- So the key factor to form an image is to obstruct most of the rays reaching the surface i.e. a pinhole camera


**Focal length** is the distance from the image plane to the camera center.



### Perspective Transform

{% mathjax() %}
$$
(\mathbf{x}, \mathbf{y}) = (\mathbf{X}, \mathbf{Y}) \frac{f}{\mathbf{Z}}
$$
{% end %}

Lines from infinity converge to a single point under this projection - this is called the **vanishing point**.

* Projective image formation
* Camera conventions
